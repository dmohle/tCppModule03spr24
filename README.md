Assignment 1: Understanding Pointers in C++
Objective: To enhance students' understanding of pointers, memory addresses, and pointer arithmetic in C++.
Description:
In this assignment, you will explore the fundamental concepts of pointers in C++. You will write programs that demonstrate the use of pointers, including pointer initialization, dereferencing, and pointer arithmetic.
For both assignments, you are required to submit your C++ programs to the GitHub Classroom remote repository. Please adhere to the following naming conventions for your source files:
•	For the pointers assignment: pointersArePowerful.cpp
•	For the linked list assignment: linkedList.cpp
•	For the extra credit (doubly linked list): doublyLinkedList.cpp

Ensure your programs compile and run correctly before submission. 

Assignment 1: Pointers in C++

pointersArePowerful.cpp Tasks:

1.	Pointer Basics
•	Write a program that declares an integer variable a and a pointer p to an integer.
•	Assign the address of a to p.
•	Print the address stored in p and the value of a using p.
•	Change the value of a using p and print the new value of a.

2.	Pointer Arithmetic
•	Create an array arr of integers with 5 elements.
•	Write a program that prints the address of each element in the array using pointer arithmetic.
•	Increment a pointer to traverse the array and print each value.

linkedList.cpp: Tasks:

Singly Linked List
•	Define a Node struct with an integer data field and a pointer to the next node.
•	Implement functions to:
•	Insert a node at the end of the list.
•	Delete a node by value.
•	Display all nodes in the list.

doublyLinkedList.cpp: Tasks:

Doubly Linked List (Advanced: Extra Credit)
•	Upgrade your Node struct to include a pointer to the previous node.
•	Modify your insertion and deletion functions to support bidirectional traversal.

Considerations for Students:
•	Pay close attention to memory management, including proper deallocation of dynamic memory to prevent memory leaks.
•	Test your implementations thoroughly with various scenarios to ensure correctness, especially edge cases such as inserting into an empty list or deleting the only node in a list.
These assignments are designed to solidify your understanding of dynamic data structures and memory management in C++. Submit your source files via the course management system by the due date. Happy coding!
